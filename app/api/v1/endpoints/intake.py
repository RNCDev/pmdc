#     # 1. Authorization Check (Handled by dependency `get_current_authenticated_publisher`)
#     #    Verify that the authenticated publisher matches publisher_id 
#     #    and has permission to submit data.
#     #    Example check (might be inside the dependency or here):
#     # if current_publisher.external_id != publisher_id or not current_publisher.can_push_data:
#     #     raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Forbidden: Publisher mismatch or lack of permission")

#     # 2. Determine Incoming Schema (Crucial Step)
#     #    This logic needs to figure out which 'publisher_in' schema applies.
#     #    - Could be based on publisher_id mapping stored in DB.
#     #    - Could involve inspecting the payload itself (less reliable).
#     #    - For MVP, might assume a specific known schema based on publisher_id.

#     if not incoming_schema_identifier:
#         # services.audit_service.log_intake_failure(db, publisher_id, payload, reason="Unknown schema")
#         raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Could not determine data schema for this publisher")

#     # 3. Validate Payload against Determined Schema (Potentially done by intake service)
#     #    Pydantic validation can occur here or within the service.
#     #    try:
#     #        validated_data = schemas.publisher_in.get_schema(incoming_schema_identifier)(**payload)
#     #    except ValidationError as e:
#     #        raise HTTPException(status_code=422, detail=f"Invalid payload format: {e}")

#     # 4. Trigger Asynchronous Processing (Recommended for SaaS interaction)
#     #    Instead of waiting for SaaS translation, queue the task.
#     #    This endpoint just acknowledges receipt.
#     try:
#         # services.intake_service.queue_intake_processing(db, publisher_id, incoming_schema_identifier, payload)
#         print(f"Queued processing for publisher {publisher_id}'s data")
#         # services.audit_service.log_intake_queued(db, publisher_id, payload)
#         return schemas.msg.Msg(msg="Data accepted for processing")
#     except Exception as e:
#         # Log critical failure during queuing
#         # services.audit_service.log_intake_failure(db, publisher_id, payload, reason=f"Failed to queue: {e}")
