# Private Markets Data Cooperative (PMDC) - Data Exchange Platform
# v. 0.1.0

## 1. Executive Summary

*   **Cooperative:** Private Markets Data Cooperative (PMDC)
*   **Mission:** To fundamentally change and improve private markets fund administration by providing a seamless, secure, and efficient platform for managing capital calls, distributions, capital accounts and basic SOI data. We hope to eliminate eliminating the pain points working with PDFs as the fundamental unit of operations in the private equity market.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Efficiency:** Streamlining fund administration processes.
*   **Accuracy:** Uncompromising commitment to data integrity and precision.
*   **Security:** Protecting sensitive financial data with robust security measures.
*   **Innovation:** Continuously improving the platform and adapting to evolving industry needs.

## 3. Market Analysis

*   **Market Size & Opportunity:** ~60 M transactions annually at capacity.
*   **Target Market Segmentation:**
    *   General Partners (GP): Manage vehicles that consume capital.
    *   GP Agents: Service providers to GPs that help manage fund accounting and operations.
    *   Limited Partners (LP): May manage vehicles or invest directly with GPs; providers of capital.
    *   LP Agents: Service providers to LPs that help manage portfolio accounting and operations.

## 10. TODO: Fake Data Demo Requirements

Develop a small, clickable web interface demonstration using consistent, fake data to illustrate the core information flow. This demo should showcase:

*   **Onboarding:**
    *   Simulated onboarding process for a new Publisher.
    *   Simulated onboarding process for a new Subscriber.
    *   Admin Interface Mockup: Simple view for an admin to approve/manage publishers and subscribers.
*   **Connecting Publisher & Subscriber:**
    *   Admin Interface Mockup: View for an admin to establish an active subscription link between a specific publisher and subscriber.
*   **Data Flow:**
    *   Publisher View: Ability to simulate publishing a transaction (e.g., a capital call) via a simple form.
    *   System View (Conceptual): Visualization of the transaction being processed:
        *   Received at Intake API.
        *   (Simulated) Sent to SaaS for translation.
        *   (Simulated) Received back from SaaS.
        *   Stored in the Canonical Database.
        *   Schema/Translation Visualization: Show examples of the data format at each stage (Publisher -> Canonical -> Subscriber).
    *   Subscriber View: Ability to view data received from subscribed publishers.
*   **History/Audit:**
    *   Publisher DMZ View: A history list showing transactions published by the selected publisher.
    *   Subscriber DMZ View: A history list showing transactions received by the selected subscriber from their subscriptions.
    *   Audit Log View: Simplified view tracing a single transaction's key steps through the system.
*   **Error Simulation:**
    *   Demonstrate how the UI might indicate a processing error for a transaction (e.g., simulated SaaS failure).
